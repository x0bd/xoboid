I think most of my love for design engineering comes from the memories I had during my attempt at being an indie gamedev, haha. The internet moniker xoboid itself was the name of my supposed game studio, but hey that's a story for another day.

From my experience the indie game developer title has the most hats from visual design, game design to complex engineering, and the thing is I enjoyed all of it, modelling in blender, writing shaders in unity and implementing pathfinding.

But because of employment reasons I had to leave gamedev and look for a job that was hireable in my location. And yes JavaScript. Started building web apps with React but I missed the freedom of design experimentation that I had with game engines, But turns out
