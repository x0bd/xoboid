		"I am a frontend engineer who enjoys crafting unforgettable experiences for the web. Right now, I am working with Next.js, Three.js and TypeScript. In my free I use my computer to decode signals from the void through code, pixel and sound experiments. Sometimes I write notes on things you can do on your computer and slowly learn Japanese.",
